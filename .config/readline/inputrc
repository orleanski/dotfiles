# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code
# To test what a key is, run cat and then press the key:
# $ cat
# ^[[A  == arrow Up
# ^[[B  == arrow Down
# ^[[D  == arrow Left
# ^[[C  == arrow Right
# ^[[5~ == Page Up
# ^[[6~ == Page Down
# To get a list of which escape sequences correspond to which keyboard-keys,
# you can use a command such as
# $ infocmp -L -1
# $ infocmp -L -1 xterm

# When tab-completing, show a menu.
